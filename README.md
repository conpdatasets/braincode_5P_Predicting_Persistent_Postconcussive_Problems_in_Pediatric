## 5P: Predicting Persistent Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics

# Overview

Concussion is a common injury occurring in children and adolescents, and results in a wide variety of effects spanning physical, cognitive (thinking), psychological/behavioural, or sleep. While most cases of concussion improve within weeks, approximately one third of children have on-going symptoms for longer than 1 month, known as persistent post concussive symptoms (PPCS).

The goal of the 5P study was to derive and validate easy to use prognosticators for clinicians to identify children and youth for risk of PPCS. A 12-point PPCS risk score was developed which includes nine diagnostic variables: sex, age, physician-diagnosed migraine history, prior concussion symptoms duration, headache, sensitivity to noise, fatigue, answering questions slowly, and errors on the Balance Error Scoring System tandem stance. Among children presenting to the emergency department with concussion and head injury within the previous 48 hours, the clinical risk score demonstrated modest ability to discriminate PPCS risk at 28 days.

This project was funded by CIHR, ONF, CHEO Foundation, CHEO Research Institute, and the University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute.
